## Parallel state-machine testing — linearisability checking.
##
## Given a recorded concurrent history of operations (each with an
## `invokeTime`, a `responseTime`, the operation tag, and the value the
## SUT actually returned), determine whether there exists a sequential
## ordering of those operations — respecting real-time happens-before
## — that is consistent with a sequential model.
##
## This is the most powerful concurrency-bug-finding technique in PBT:
## `quickcheck-state-machine` (Haskell) and PropEr (Erlang) have it;
## most other PBT libraries don't. The algorithm here is the Wing-Gong
## definition implemented as a happens-before-respecting backtracking
## search. Worst case `O(n!)` but in practice prunes hard — the
## practical bug-finding regime (≤ 10 ops, 2-3 threads) runs in
## milliseconds.
##
## **Current scope.** This module ships the algorithmic core
## (`isLinearisable`). A user with a real concurrent SUT records the
## `(threadId, invokeTime, responseTime, opId, observedRet)` of each
## operation — typically with `getMonoTime().ticks` before and after
## the call — and hands the resulting `seq[LinEvent]` to
## `isLinearisable`. A thread-based runner that *generates* concurrent
## histories automatically (spawning suffixes, recording timestamps,
## then handing the history to the checker) is the natural follow-up;
## the algorithmic core ships first so the Wing-Gong definition is
## in place and tested independent of the thread-orchestration layer.

      ## When not linearisable, a short explanation: the operation we
      ## couldn't place + the divergence between model and SUT.
